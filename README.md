2. Create a .env file and add `OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY` to store the API key securely.
3. Set up an environmental variable by navigating to Settings > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables, and create a new variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the value of your secret key.
4. In your `main.py`, initialize the OpenAI client with `client = OpenAI()` to gain access to the API key.
